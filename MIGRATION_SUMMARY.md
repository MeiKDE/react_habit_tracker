## 🚀 **Next Steps to Complete Setup**

### 1. **Create Appwrite Project**

1. Go to https://cloud.appwrite.io/console
2. Create a new project
3. Note your Project ID

### 2. **Create Database**

1. In Appwrite console, go to "Databases"
2. Create a new database
3. Note your Database ID

### 3. **Generate API Key**

1. Go to "Settings" > "API Keys"
2. Create API key with scopes: `users.read`, `users.write`, `databases.read`, `databases.write`
3. Note your API key

### 4. **Configure Environment**

Update these values in `app.json`:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "extra": {
      "APPWRITE_ENDPOINT": "https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1",
      "APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID": "your-actual-project-id",
      "APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID": "your-actual-database-id",
      "APPWRITE_USERS_COLLECTION_ID": "users",
      "APPWRITE_HABITS_COLLECTION_ID": "habits",
      "APPWRITE_HABIT_COMPLETIONS_COLLECTION_ID": "habit_completions"
    }
  }
}
```

Update these values in `create-appwrite-collections.js`:

```javascript
const APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID = "your-actual-project-id";
const APPWRITE_API_KEY = "your-actual-api-key";
const DATABASE_ID = "your-actual-database-id";
```

### 5. **Create Collections**

```bash
npm run setup
```

### 6. **Test the App**

```bash
npx expo start
```

## 🔍 **Testing Checklist**

### **Before First Run**

- [ ] Updated app.json with your Appwrite credentials
- [ ] Updated create-appwrite-collections.js with your API key
- [ ] Ran `npm run setup` to create collections
- [ ] Verified collections exist in Appwrite console

### **Authentication Testing**

- [ ] Can create new account
- [ ] Can sign in with existing account
- [ ] Can sign out
- [ ] Session persists on app restart

### **Habit Management Testing**

- [ ] Can create new habits
- [ ] Can complete habits (swipe right)
- [ ] Can delete habits (swipe left)
- [ ] Streak calculations work correctly

### **Connection Testing**

- [ ] Use ConnectionTest component in auth screen
- [ ] Verify all Appwrite endpoints are reachable
- [ ] Check database and project configuration

## 🐛 **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues**

1. **"Unable to resolve path to module 'appwrite'"**

   - Solution: Run `npm install`

2. **Collection creation fails**

   - Check API key permissions
   - Verify project and database IDs

3. **Authentication fails**

   - Verify project ID in app.json
   - Check Appwrite endpoint accessibility

4. **Network errors on iOS**
   - Verify NSAppTransportSecurity in app.json

### **Debug Tips**

- Check console logs for detailed error messages
- Use ConnectionTest component to verify Appwrite setup
- Verify all environment variables are set correctly
- Check Appwrite console for user activity and data

## 🎉 **Migration Complete!**

Your React Native app now uses the same Appwrite backend as your Next.js app, providing:

- **Unified data structure** across platforms
- **Real-time synchronization** between web and mobile
- **Scalable authentication** system
- **Professional backend** infrastructure

The app is ready for production use once you complete the setup steps above!
